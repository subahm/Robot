# Robot
Source code for an autonomous robot built using VEX kit and programmed in RobotC. This robot has two driving wheels at the front and a caster wheel entered at the back. It has an ultrasonic range finder attached at the front and two infrared phototransistors attached on each side of the range finder. These sensors are used to detect a target emitting infrared signals. It also has a retractable arm that places the object on the target. This was one of the assignments that we had to do in first year engineering and there were two other people on my team(Gregory and Zhenhan) who helped in building the robot.
